

It's the most wonderful time of the year 
With the kids jingle belling
And everyone telling you "be of good cheer" 
It's the most wonderful time of the year

It's the hap-happiest season of all
With those holiday greetings 
And gay happy meetings when friends come to call 
It's the hap-happiest season of all 

There'll be parties for hosting 
Marshmallows for toasting 
And caroling out in the snow 
There'll be scary ghost stories 
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago 

It's the most wonderful time of the year 
There'll be much mistletoeing 
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near 
It's the most wonderful time of the year 

There'll be parties for hosting 
Marshmallows for toasting 
And caroling out in the snow 
There'll be scary ghost stories 
And tales of the glories
Of Christmases long, long ago 

It's the most wonderful time of the year 
There'll be much mistletoeing 
And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near 
It's the most wonderful time 
It's the most wonderful time 
It's the most wonderful time 
It's the most wonderful time of the year
