The reasons I can't have you, are so easy to fix
I didn't really plan to, but I'ma do it for this
The reasons I can't have you, isn't so complicated
Baby if you let me I won't hesitate-ate

All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...)

I know there's been stigma 'round me
I know you heard things about me
You sleep one eye closed
Too scared to get heartbroke
Heard too many lies told
Don't make this shit unfold
I could tell why you would doubt me
I hit one time, you can't live without me
Girl I'm just peakin', I'm just tryna be on top of you
On top of you
