Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind 
Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm blind

But I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me 

Take a look in the mirror and what do you see
Do you see it clearer or are you deceived in what you believe 

Cos I'm only human after all, you're only human after all 
Don't put the blame on me 
Don't put your blame on me

Some people got the real problems 
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them 
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me 

Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry, making you cry

Cos I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me, don't put the blame on me

Some people got the real problems 
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them 
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me 
I'm only human I make mistakes
I'm only human that's all it takes to put the blame on me 
Don't put your blame on me

I'm no prophet or messiah 
Should go looking somewhere higher 

I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me, don't put the blame on me
I'm only human I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
