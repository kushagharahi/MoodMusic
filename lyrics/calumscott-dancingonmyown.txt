

Somebody said you got a new friend
Does she love you better than I can
There's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at I bet she's around
And yeah I know it's stupid
But I just got a see it for myself

I'm in the corner watching you kiss her
Oh, oh, oh
And I'm right over here. Why can't you see me?
Oh, oh, oh
And I'm givin' it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home
Oh
I keep dancing on my own

I just wanna dance all night
I'm all messed up I'm so out of line
Stilettos and broken bottles
I'm spinning around in circles

And I'm in the corner watching you kiss her
Oh, oh, oh
And I'm right over here. Why can't you see me?
Oh, oh, oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home
Oh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, no no

So far away
But still so near
The lights come on
The music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

And I'm in the corner watching you kiss her
Oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home
Oh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, no

And I'm in the corner watching you kiss her
Oh no
And I'm right over here. Why can't you see me?
Oh no
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home
Ooh
I keep dancing on my own

So far away
But still so near
The lights come on
The music dies
But you don't see me standing here
