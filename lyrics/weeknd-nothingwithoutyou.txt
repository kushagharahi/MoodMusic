I feel the darkness, when I'm away from you
Hey, don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you yeah
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I could've fled, to be with by myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)

Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it?
Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same

I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you, oh
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I could've fled, to be with by myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
(Nothing, nothing, nothing)

When I feel the love, girl I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch, touch, touch
(I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you)
