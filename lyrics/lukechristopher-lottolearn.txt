If I was the music would you be the dancer?
If I was the student would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner would you be the preacher?
Would you be my
It's the dun dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn I'll admit it
It's the dun dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn I'll admit it

Feeling like a digit in a system, just another stupid number
I don't know, know, know
Everything is twisted i can feel it
It's another stupid summer where it's cold, cold, cold
And we can do it on our own
Head up to a place where baby no one goes
A rocket full of Liquor, a Polaroid for Pictures
Baby you should stop me, before I lose control
How a perfect a person am I, go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars what do they see?

If I was the question would you be my answer?
If I was the music would you be the dancer?
If I was the student would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner would you be the preacher?
Would you be my
It's the dun dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn I'll admit it
It's the dun dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn I'll admit it
And the dun dun dun
We still got a lot of shit to learn just admit it
And the dun dun dun
We still got a lot of shit to learn don't you get it?

Got your finger on the trigger and you aiming at the mirror
Don't you shoot that ain't you, nah
Cause on the outside you pretend but you hurting in the inner
What's the truth now
How a perfect a person am I, go through your purse and put on your disguise
You see the stars, but they just see the skies
And you see my scars what do they see?

If I was the question would you be my answer?
If I was the music would you be the dancer?
If I was the student would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner would you be the preacher?
Would you be my
It's the dun dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn I'll admit it
It's the dun dun dun
I still got a lot of shit to learn I'll admit it

If I was the question would you be my answer?
If I was the music would you be the dancer?
If I was the student would you be the teacher?
If I was the sinner would you be the preacher?

Would you be my
It's the dun dun dun
