P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah
All red lamb' just to tease you, ah
None of these toys on lease too, ah
Made your whole year in a week too, yeah
Main bitch out of your league too, ah
Side bitch out of your league too, ah

House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean up with her face, man
I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me I don't see the shade
Switch up my style I take any lane
I switch up my cup I kill any pain

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Look what you've done!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm a motherfuckin' Starboy
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Look what you've done!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm a motherfuckin' Starboy

Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that roadster SV, ah
Pockets over weight getting hefty, ah
Coming for the king that's a far cry
I come alive in the fall time I
No competition I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition

House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean up with her face, man
I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking bout me I don't see the shade
Switch up my style I take any lane
I switch up my cup I kill any pain

Let a nigga Brad Pitt legend of the fall
Took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek groove in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
Hundred on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love we just pray for cars

House so empty need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean up with her face
Man I love my baby
You talking money need a hearing aid
You talking bout me I don't see your shade
Switch up my style I take any lane
I switch up my cup I kill any pain

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Look what you've done!
