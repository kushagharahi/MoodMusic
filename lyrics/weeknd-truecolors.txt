Baby girl, who else been with you
It's gon' come to my attention either way, yeah
And I understand
Baby girl, we all had a past
I'd much rather hear the truth come straight from you

So if I love you
It'd be just for you
So when I'm touching you
Can I trust in you
Can I trust in you, oh baby

Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors

True colors, true colors

What's done is done
Now that I'm the only one
If you tell me I'll accept what you've been through, oh yeah
And I don't believe all this inconsistency
I've been hearing different stories about you

So if I love you
It'd be just for you
So when I'm touching you
Can I trust in you
Can I trust in you, oh baby

Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors

You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you
Baby, show me you're a keeper
