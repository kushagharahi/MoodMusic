You can be my guided light
Keep me, company in the night
That's all I need, all I want
Is for you to stay a little longer now
With arms around me, like a border
Like the air I breathe, I let you in
Keep me warm underneath my skin
Cause I'm

Giving in to your touch
I can never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean

You can be my safety zone
Somewhere I can go when I feel alone
That's all I need, all I want
Is to stay a little longer now
Arms around me like a border
Like an endless stream
You take me in
To a place that I've never been
Now I'm

Giving in to your touch
I will never get enough
Diving deep into the ocean
Ocean
Ocean
Ocean
