I had a vision
A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratching counter tops, I was screaming
My back arched like a cat, my position couldn't stop you were hitting it
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, (I love it), Starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, Starboy

[The Weeknd:]
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a Stargirl
