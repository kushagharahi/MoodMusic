See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tip toe, tip toe

Ah!
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh!)
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me (ah)
You're a real life fantasy, you're a real life fantasy (huh!)
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa
[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa
[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)

[Explicit:] God damn
[Clean and radio:] Hot damn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, "Yes, ma'am."
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh!)
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me (ah)
You're a real life fantasy, you're a real life fantasy (huh!)
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously
Whoa

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa
[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa
[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Oh ah
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Oh ah
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)

[Explicit:] You're fucking delicious
[Clean and radio:] You're crazy delicious
Talk to me, girl

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa
[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)

[Explicit:] Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
[Clean and radio:] Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)

Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready; I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)
