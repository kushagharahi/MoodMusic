I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smokin' that la-la-la-la-la

Do what you want!
I'm telling you, let me into your heart
Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us fallin' apart
You know that I love you
So let me into your heart
Let me into your heart
Do you really love me?
I'm gon' get you, girl, ahhhh
This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been, you can see the sun
Let me into your heart!
I really love you, girl

Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love

I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Oh my God, I
Let me into
Girl you really got a hold, woo!
