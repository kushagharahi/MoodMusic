

Money rains from the sky above
But keep the change cause I've got enough
A little time and some tenderness
You'll never buy my love

No other thing that's as precious to
No other, there's no other
Than a heart that feels and a heart that's true
Something that you got to notice girl

Woh!
Take my hand
Or take over
Take my hand, you
Or-or take over
Take my hand, you
Or take over
Take my hand
Or take over

These presents don't really come for free
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love

You buy me this and you buy me that
To win over, win me over
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Something that you've got to notice

Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song
It's a shame but I've got to go

Woh!
Take my hand
Or take over
Take my hand, you
Or-or take over
Take my hand, you
Or take over
Take my hand
Or take over
