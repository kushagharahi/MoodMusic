10 bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard then your money start expandin'
I got model bitches wanna lick me like some candy
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Savage bitch, but no I'm not Randy
Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a plan B
And I'm sippin' on that Codeine, not Brandy

I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace
Diamonds got the flu, tryin' not to catch this
I left that ho alone cause she was ratchet
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me

[21 Savage & Future:]
Flexin' on that bitch, hold up, flexin' on my ex-bitch
Bought a necklace on that bitch, turn up
Her friend gon' lick me like a fruit roll up
She in her feelin' on the ground, grow up
21, flexin' on that bitch, hold up
I ain't textin' back that bitch, hold up
I ain't stressin' bout that bitch, hold up
21 gon' get the stick, hold up
Hold up, hold up, bitch I like to ball
Without no weave, you bald
Hold up, hold up, bitch I spent your rent inside the mall
Told her she got a nigga but he broke, she lost
Hold up at this private location
Hold up, put her back in rotation
Hold up, bitches on me, immigration
Hold up, goin' through the translations

I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch
Hold up, I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch

Diamonds got the flu, tryin' not to catch this
I left that ho alone cause she was ratchet
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me

[21 Savage & Future:]
Hold up, bitch my Rolex on fleek
Hold up, bitch my diamonds on fleek
Hold up, I got gold on my teeth
Hold up, you got Rainbow on your feet?
Hold up, corny niggas don't impress me
Hold up, never let a bitch dress me
Hold up, can't no motherfuckin' judge check me
Hold up, I don't give a fuck about no ring
Hold up, money make my old bitches hate me
Hold up, bitch you still stay on Section-8
Hold up, my new bitch wetter than a lake
Hold up, and she love to let me paint her face
Hold up, fell in love with some good throat
Hold up, fell in love with some good throat
Hold up, ripped them confidential papers up
Hold up, you done made me wake my savage up

[Future:]
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Hendrix bitch, you know I'm not Jimi
Hit 'em with no condoms, ship her right quick out the country
And I'm sippin' codeine, tats all on my stomach
