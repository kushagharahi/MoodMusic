At least until the sun goes down
When you're gone, I lose faith
I lose everything I have found
Heart strings, violins
That's what I hear when you're by my side wooh
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side woohh

But when you're gone the music go-wo-woah-wo-woah-oahs
I lose my rhythm, lose my sow-oh-oh-oh-uh-oh
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know all that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know all that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

Baby when we were young
There was nothing to make believe
And the songs that we sang
They were written for you and me
Melodies on repeat
That's what I hear when you're by my side wooh
Yeah, that's what I hear when you're by my side wooh

But when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know all that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know all that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

Woo-ooo, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
Woo-ooo, underneath the disco light, it's alright
We could make the perfect sound
We could make the perfect sound

But when you're gone the music goes
I lose my rhythm, lose my soul
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know all that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

So don't let this be our final song
So hear me out before you say the night is over
I want you to know all that we gotta, gotta carry on
So don't let this be our final song

Woo-ooo, take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
Woo-ooo, underneath the disco light, it's alright
We could make the perfect sound
Woo-ooo. take us to a higher ground
Here and now, whatever you do, just don't look down
Woo-ooo, underneath the disco light, it's alright
Don't let this be our final song
