

Heaven in her mouth, got a hell of a tongue
I can feel her teeth when I drive on a bump
Fingers letting go of the wheel when I cum
Whe-wheel when I cum, whe-wheel when I cum
David Carradine, I'ma die when I cum
She just givin' head, she don't know what I've done
Like I'm James Dean, I'ma die when I'm young
Die when I'm young, die when I'm young

Heaven knows that I've been told
Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo
And she said that she'll pray for me
I said, "It's too late for me"
'Cause I think it's safe to say...

This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life

Valhalla is where all the righteous are led
Mulholland's where all the damned will be kept
Devil on my lap and a cross on my neck
Cross on my neck, cross on my neck
Over 45, I'ma drift on a bend
Do a buck 20, I'ma fly off the edge
Everybody said it would hurt in the end
Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'

She said that she'll pray for me
I said, "It's too late for me"
'Cause I think it's safe to say...

This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life

Angels all singin' in monasteries, yeah
My soul is burning in LaFerraris
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Halos are given to ordinary lives
No, but this ain't ordinary life

This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
This ain't ordinary life
No ordinary life
Woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh
