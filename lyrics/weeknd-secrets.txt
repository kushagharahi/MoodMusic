My love, my love
And I know that you want them too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

Wipe the lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes
You can't hide it
You can't be the one
I realize, we're divided

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
