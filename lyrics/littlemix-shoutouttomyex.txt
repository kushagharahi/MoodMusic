Heard he in love with some other chick
Yeah yeah, that hurt me, I'll admit
Forget that boy, I'm over it
I hope she gettin' better sex
Hope she ain't fakin' it like I did, babe
Took four long years to call it quits
Forget that boy, I'm over it

Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate you's" and the tattoos
Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
Go ahead, babe, I'mma live my life, my life, yeah

Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now, well, I
I'm all the way up, I swear you'll never bring me down
Shout out to my ex, you're really quite the man
You made my heart break and that made me who I am
Here's to my ex, hey, look at me now, well, I

Oh, I deleted all your pics
Then blocked your number from my phone
Yeah yeah, you took all you could get
But you ain't getting this love no more
'Cause now I'm living so legit (so legit)
Even though you broke my heart in two, baby
But I snapped right back, I'm so brand new, baby (I'm so brand new)
Boy, read my lips, I'm over you, over you

Guess I should say thank you
For the "hate you's" and the tattoos
Oh baby, I'm cool by the way
Ain't sure I loved you anyway
Go ahead, babe, I'mma live my life, my life, yeah
