Been running around for so long
Now I caught you, I won't let you go
You got that thing that I been looking for
And you got a heart full of gold
And that's really turning me on

You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Everything that I dreamed of, now I can paint our picture
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Making my life much greener, yeah yes

Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, so we should be sexual
Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, so we should be sexual

You got something that I ain't seen before
You've opened a million doors
All I can say is I adore you
You got something that I ain't seen before
Hold me cause baby, I'm yours
Oh, I can't wait until we get home

You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Everything that I dreamed of, now I can paint our picture
You are, you are, you are, you are, you are
Making my life much greener, so I wanna say, yeah

Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, so we should be sexual
Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, so we should be sexual

I don't know what you done, but I can't get enough
Cause you give me that rush, I don't want it to stop

Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, we should be sexual
Just say you feel the way that I feel
I'm feeling sexual, we should be sexual
