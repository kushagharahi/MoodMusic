Baby, you are calm, you are so calm, yeah
Tell me where it went wrong
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, and you just need to touch
Thinking twice on my one
But you just need to trust

You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never abrupt
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh

What do you expect now?
Only thing left is the sex now
Cause baby, too vexed now
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When it touched my mouth
You were more than a fuck
Thinking twice on a one
But you just need to trust

You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never abrupt
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh

[Cashmere Cat:]
Attention
(Love all the attention, baby)
Attention
(Love all the attention, baby)

You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never abrupt
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
