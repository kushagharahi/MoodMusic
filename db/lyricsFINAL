Till I Collapse	Eminem	\n\n[Intro: Eminem]\nCause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak\nAnd when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up\nBut you gotta search within you\nAnd gotta find that inner strength\nAnd just pull that shit out of you\nAnd get that motivation to not give up\nAnd not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nTill I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em\nTill the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em\nCause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em\nAnd I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem\nSubliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em?\nWomen are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom\nAdrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop\nAmoxicillin's just not real enough\nThe criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain\nA minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners\nYou're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it\nLike I showed you the spirit of God lives in us\nYou hear it a lot, lyrics to shock\nIs it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?\nFa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up\nYou bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nMusic is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get\nWhen you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit\nThis is your moment, and every single minute you spend\nTryna hold on to it because you may never get it again\nSo while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can\nAnd when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end\nBecause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in\nI got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in\nIt goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie\nAndre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me\nBut in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy\nSo when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me\nThat's why you see me walk around\nLike nothing's bothering me\nEven though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me\nYou hate it, but you know respect you got to give me\nThe press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nSoon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart\nWhat is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart\nAnd it's absurd how people hang on every word\nI'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve\nBut I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved\nIf I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first\nCause in my heart of hearts\nI know nothing could ever be worse\nThat's why I'm clever when I put together every verse\nMy thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict\nI rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers\nBut I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles\nThe fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers\nSo this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em\nThe track is on some battling raps, who want some static?\nCause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters\nA plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\nTill the roof comes off, till the lights go out\nTill my legs give out, can't shut my mouth\nTill the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps\nI'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse\n\n[Outro: Eminem (Nate Dogg)]\nUntil the roof (until the roof)\nThe roof comes off (the roof comes off)\nUntil my legs (until my legs)\nGive out from (underneath me)\nI will not fall, I will stand tall\nFeels like no one can beat me\n\n	0.466753	0.204880	0.552089	0.014767	0.555122	sadness

Rap God	Eminem	\n\n[Produced by DVLP]\n\n[Intro sample + Eminem]\nLook, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings\nBut I'm only going to get this one chance\nSomething's wrong, I can feel it\nSix minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!\nJust a feeling I've got\nLike something's about to happen, but I don't know what\nIf that means what I think it means\nWe're in trouble, big trouble\nAnd if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances\nYou are just what the doc ordered\n\n[Hook 1]\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms\nAre long enough to slap box, slap box?\nThey said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot\n\n[Verse 1]\nBut for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes\nI got a laptop in my back pocket\nMy pen'll go off when I half-cock it\nGot a fat knot from that rap profit\nMade a livin' and a killin' off it\nEver since Bill Clinton was still in office\nWith Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his, nutsack\nI'm an MC still as honest\nBut as rude and as indecent as all hell\nSyllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)\nThis flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop\nYou don't really wanna get into a pissin' match\nWith this rappity-rap, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'\nBackpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack\nAnd at the exact same time\nI attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that\nI'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table\nOver the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half\nOnly realized it was ironic\nI was signed to Aftermath after the fact\nHow could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs\nFeel my wrath of attack\nRappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad\nIt's actually disastrously bad for the wack\nWhile I'm masterfully constructing this master piece\n\n[Hook 2]\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nNow, who thinks their arms\nAre long enough to slap box, slap box?\nLet me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard\nEverybody want the key and the secret\nTo rap immortality like I have got\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, to be truthful the blueprint's\nSimply rage and youthful exuberance\nEverybody loves to root for a nuisance\nHit the Earth like an asteroid\nDid nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew)\nMC's get taken to school with this music\nCause I use it as a vehicle to "bust a rhyme"\nNow I lead a new school full of students\nMe? I'm a product of Rakim\nLakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren\nYella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim\nInspired enough to one day grow up\nBlow up and be in a position\nTo meet RunD.M.C., and induct them\nInto the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame\nEven though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames\nOnly Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame\nOn the wall of (shame)\nYou fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames\nOff a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?\nLittle gay-looking boy\nSo gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy\nYou're witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy\n"Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy\nYou get a thumbs up, pat on the back\nAnd a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy\nHey, looking boy! What you say, looking boy?\nI get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy\nI'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit\nGet outta my face, looking boy!\nBasically, boy, you're never gonna be capable\nOf keeping up with the same pace, looking boy\n\n[Hook 3]\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racing around the track\nCall me NASCAR, NASCAR\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod\nThis planet's Krypton; no, Asgard, Asgard\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off, then I'm reloadin'\nImmediately with these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken; I'm the walking dead\nBut I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin'\nBut I got your mom deep-throatin'\nI'm out my Ramen Noodle\nWe have nothing in common, poodle\nI'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm\nAnd pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes\nTo maybe try to help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines\nJust in case, cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big and here they come tryin'\nTo censor you, like that one line\nI said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I tried to say\n"I'll take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9"\nSee if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm\nMorphin' into an immortal, coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\nYou write normal? Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya\nLike when Fabolous made Ray J mad\nCause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSinging to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)\nUh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma\nYou assumin' I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you say is ricocheting off of me\nAnd it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\nCause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n"Oh, he's too mainstream."\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous\nThey confuse it; "It's not hip-hop, it's pop."\nCause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it\n"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use."\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice\nYour songs you could sacrifice virgins to?\nUngh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself, cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!\nI'm drunk, so Satan, take the fucking wheel!\nI'm asleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"\nBut in my head there's something\nI can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me\nThey're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\nThen you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!\nDon't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake\nIf you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard; be a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a god?\n\n	0.518869	0.169377	0.175555	0.147150	0.471270	anger
